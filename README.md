# Apex Unit Test w/ Mocking

This repo holds Apex Unit Tests that use the Apex HTTP mock capabilities to mock 
callout to a fictive material quantity endpoint on SAP. It also holds Apex Unit Test 
using mocking instead of direct database calls with SOQL. The latter is using the 
[Financial Force Apex Mocking libraries](https://github.com/apex-enterprise-patterns).
